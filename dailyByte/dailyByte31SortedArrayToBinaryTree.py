# Given an array of numbers sorted in 
# ascending order, return a height-balanced binary search 
# tree using every number from the array.
# Note: height-balanced meaning that the level 
# of any nodeâ€™s two subtrees should not differ by more than one.

# Ex: Given the following nums...

# nums = [1, 2, 3] return a reference to the following tree...
#        2
#       /  \
#      1    3
# Ex: Given the following nums...

# nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] return a reference to the following tree...
#         3
#        / \
#       2   5
#      /   / \
#     1   4   6
